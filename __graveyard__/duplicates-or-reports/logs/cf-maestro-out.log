2025-12-28T02:56:12: NAME:
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-12-28T02:56:12: 
2025-12-28T02:56:12: USAGE:
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:56:12: 
2025-12-28T02:56:12: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:56:12: 
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:56:12:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:56:13:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:56:13: 
2025-12-28T02:56:13: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:56:13:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:56:13:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:56:13:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:56:13: 
2025-12-28T02:56:13:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:56:13:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:56:13:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:56:13:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:56:14: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:56:14:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:56:14:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:56:14:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:56:14: 
2025-12-28T02:56:14:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:56:14:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:56:14:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:56:14:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:56:16: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:56:16:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:56:16:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:56:16:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:56:16: 
2025-12-28T02:56:16:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:56:16:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:56:16:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:56:16:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:56:18:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:56:18: 
2025-12-28T02:56:18: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:56:18:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:56:18:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:56:18:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:56:18: 
2025-12-28T02:56:18:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:56:18:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:56:18:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:56:18:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:57:26: NAME:
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-12-28T02:57:26: 
2025-12-28T02:57:26: USAGE:
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:57:26: 
2025-12-28T02:57:26: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:57:26: 
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:57:26:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:57:26:    --metrics value          Listen address for metrics reporting. If no address is passed cloudflared will try to bind to [localhost:20241 localhost:20242 localhost:20243 localhost:20244 localhost:20245].
2025-12-28T02:57:26: If all are unavailable, a random port will be used. Note that when running cloudflared from an virtual
2025-12-28T02:57:26: environment the default address binds to all interfaces, hence, it is important to isolate the host

2025-12-28T02:57:27:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:57:27: 
2025-12-28T02:57:27: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:57:27: 
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:57:27: NAME:
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-12-28T02:57:27: 
2025-12-28T02:57:27: USAGE:
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:57:27: 
2025-12-28T02:57:27: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:57:27: 
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:57:27:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:57:27:    --metrics value          Listen address for metrics reporting. If no address is passed cloudflared will try to bind to [localhost:20241 localhost:20242 localhost:20243 localhost:20244 localhost:20245].
2025-12-28T02:57:27: If all are unavailable, a random port will be used. Note that when running cloudflared from an virtual
2025-12-28T02:57:27: environment the default address binds to all interfaces, hence, it is important to isolate the host

2025-12-28T02:57:28:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-12-28T02:57:28: 
2025-12-28T02:57:28: USAGE:
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:57:28: 
2025-12-28T02:57:28: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:57:28: 
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:57:28:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:57:29: NAME:
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-12-28T02:57:29: 
2025-12-28T02:57:29: USAGE:
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:57:29: 
2025-12-28T02:57:29: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:57:29: 
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:57:29:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:57:30: NAME:
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-12-28T02:57:30: 
2025-12-28T02:57:30: USAGE:
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:57:30: 
2025-12-28T02:57:30: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:57:30: 
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:57:30:   any old connection records.

2025-12-28T02:57:35: NAME:
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   cloudflared tunnel run - Proxy a local web server by running the given tunnel
2025-12-28T02:57:35: 
2025-12-28T02:57:35: USAGE:
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   cloudflared tunnel [tunnel command options] run [subcommand options] [TUNNEL]
2025-12-28T02:57:35: 
2025-12-28T02:57:35: DESCRIPTION:
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   Runs the tunnel identified by name or UUID, creating highly available connections
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   between your server and the Cloudflare edge. You can provide name or UUID of tunnel to run either as the
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   last command line argument or in the configuration file using "tunnel: TUNNEL".
2025-12-28T02:57:35: 
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   This command requires the tunnel credentials file created when "cloudflared tunnel create" was run,
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   however it does not need access to cert.pem from "cloudflared login" if you identify the tunnel by UUID.
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   If you experience other problems running the tunnel, "cloudflared tunnel cleanup" may help by removing
2025-12-28T02:57:35:   any old connection records.
